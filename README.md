# Kent M. Schaeffer

_Engineer first. Writer always. Making complex systems crystal clear and understandable for humans._

## Welcome

I'm a senior technical writer and engineering leader with 15+ years of experience spanning software development, network infrastructure, and enterprise systems. I specialize in turning complex architectures, tools, and processes into clear, actionable documentation that empowers technical teams.

My foundation as a software engineer and infrastructure architect means I don’t just write about systems—I’ve built them, debugged them, and scaled them. That hands-on experience shapes the way I document APIs, internal tools, change workflows, and cloud deployments.

In addition to written documentation, I create visual artifacts like logical app diagrams, network architecture maps, and process flows that align cross-functional teams around shared understanding.

This portfolio features a few examples of what I do best: technical references, onboarding guides, SOPs, and visual documentation that help engineers, analysts, and stakeholders move faster with confidence.
